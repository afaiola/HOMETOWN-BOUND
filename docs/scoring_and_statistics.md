# Scoring

Module score is calculated by how many cognitive impairment (CI) levels off the player is performing. For example, if a player performs at a CI level of 4, but is diagnosed at a CI of 2, then their score is 3/5 stars (3=5-(4-2)). Scores are calculated in `ScoreCalculator.cs`.

The final scores are an average of all the stars from a level.

On the statistics page there are options to filter the data shown on the graphs. The cognitive impairment
level dropdown lets one compare the [Patient Data](patient_data.md) to a specific cognitive level baseline (See [CI Data](ci_data.md) for details).
